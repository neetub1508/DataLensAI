# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Data Lens AI
**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 3 August 2025

---

## 1. Overview
Data Lens AI is a modern analytics platform inspired by the UI/UX of [Beginner React Challenges](https://beginner-react-challenges.webdevcody.com/). The application will provide a seamless experience for users to register, log in, and interact with data, with robust role management, internationalization (i18N), and support for both dark and light themes.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Deliver a secure, scalable analytics platform with a modern UI/UX.
- Support user authentication and registration via email.
- Implement a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- Ensure future extensibility for user and role management.
- Provide i18N support for global reach.
- Offer both dark and light UI themes.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Authentication & Registration
- Users can register using their email address and password.
- Email verification is required for new registrations.
- Users can log in using their email and password.
- Password reset functionality via email.
- Store user information in a `users` table.

#### Users Table (Postgres)
| Column Name     | Type           | Constraints                        | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| id              | UUID           | PK, auto-generated                  | Unique user identifier                       |
| email           | VARCHAR(255)   | UNIQUE, NOT NULL                    | User's email address                         |
| password_hash   | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL                            | Hashed password                              |
| is_verified     | BOOLEAN        | DEFAULT FALSE                       | Email verification status                    |
| created_at      | TIMESTAMP      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP           | Account creation timestamp                   |
| updated_at      | TIMESTAMP      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP           | Last update timestamp                        |
| last_login_at   | TIMESTAMP      | NULLABLE                            | Last login timestamp                         |
| locale          | VARCHAR(10)    | DEFAULT 'en'                        | Preferred language/locale                    |
| status          | VARCHAR(20)    | DEFAULT 'active'                    | User status (active, suspended, deleted, etc) |

#### Future-Proofing
- Use UUIDs for user IDs for scalability and security.
- Include `locale` for i18N support.
- `status` field for account lifecycle management.

### 3.2 Role Management (RBAC)
- Roles can be created dynamically by admins.
- Users can have multiple roles (many-to-many relationship).
- Roles define permissions for various actions.
- Default roles: `admin`, `user` (more can be added as needed).

#### Tables
- `roles` (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
- `user_roles` (user_id, role_id, assigned_at)
- `permissions` (id, name, description)
- `role_permissions` (role_id, permission_id)

#### Architecture
- Use a flexible RBAC model with join tables for user-role and role-permission relationships.
- Admins can create, update, or delete roles and assign permissions.
- Permissions are granular and can be extended as the application grows.

### 3.3 UI/UX
- UI/UX should closely follow [Beginner React Challenges](https://beginner-react-challenges.webdevcody.com/) for consistency and modern design.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Support for dark and light themes (user-selectable, with system default detection).
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

### 3.4 Internationalization (i18N)
- All UI text must be translatable.
- Support for multiple languages (start with English, allow for easy addition of others).
- Store user locale preference in the `users` table.

### 3.5 Admin Features
- Admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions.
- Ability to create, update, and delete roles and assign them to users.
- View user activity and status.

### 3.6 Security
- Use industry-standard password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, argon2).
- Secure session management (JWT or similar).
- CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection protection.
- Audit logging for admin actions.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Fast response times, optimized queries.
- **Scalability:** Designed for future growth (horizontal scaling, microservices-ready).
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase, clear documentation.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features, roles, and permissions.
- **Reliability:** High availability, regular backups.

---

## 5. Technology Stack (Current Implementation)

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for enterprise-grade performance, security, and ORM capabilities.
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul for API management (future enhancement).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate ORM. Redis for caching and session management.
- **Message Queue/Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka or NATS for event-driven architecture (planned enhancement).
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js 14+) with TypeScript, leveraging server-side rendering and static generation for performance. Tailwind CSS for responsive theming.
- **Authentication:** Spring Security with JWT tokens, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect support.
- **i18N:** react-i18next (frontend), Spring Boot internationalization (backend).
- **Theming:** CSS variables with Tailwind CSS, dark/light mode support.
- **Deployment & Development:** Docker containers with docker-compose for development. Kubernetes deployment ready.
- **Database Migrations:** Flyway for version-controlled database schema migrations.
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI integration.
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, TestContainers for integration testing.
- **Build Tool:** Maven with multi-module project structure.
- **Other:** Bean Validation (JSR-303), Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring, and comprehensive error handling.
